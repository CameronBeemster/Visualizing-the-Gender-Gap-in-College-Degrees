# Visualizing the Gender Gap in College Degrees

Hello! Thank you for checking out my project.

This notebook is for a project I did while learning data science/analytics with <a href='https://www.dataquest.io/'>Dataquest</a>. The goal of this project was to create data visualizations for specfic college majors that gave insight into the gender gap within them.

The included pdf file has the final plots for 17 majors.
